- Persistent environment variables stored in `$HOME/kerno.toml`
- Session history tracking

## Quick Start

Install via Cargo:

```bash
cargo install kerno
```

Run the shell:

```bash
kerno
```

---

## Configuration

Kerno automatically loads environment variables from:

```bash
~/.kerno.toml
```

To add persistent variables:
```bash
set FOO bar
```

Or edit the TOML file directly:
```toml
FOO = "bar"
PATH = "/usr/local/bin"
```

---

## Examples

```bash
echo Hello world
set NAME Kerno
get NAME
scanpath              # List all system executables
cd src
ls
```

---

## Why Kerno?

Because sometimes you want a shell that is:
- Lightweight
- Understandable
- Hackable
- Rusty
